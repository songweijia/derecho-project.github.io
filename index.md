# The Derecho Project

Derecho is an open-source C++ distributed computing toolkit that provides strong forms of distributed coordination and consistency at RDMA speeds. Its goal is to be a library for building high-speed replicated systems on RDMA networks, with a simple and flexible interface that is much easier to use than standard RDMA drivers. The platform is currently under development by a Cornell-based team that includes Jonathan Behrens (@fintelia), Sagar Jha (@sagarjha), Matthew Milano (@mpmilano), Edward Tremel (@etremel), and Weijia Song (@songweijia) as well as Professors Ken Birman and Robbert van Renesse. 


## Source Code

You can download the source code for Derecho from our main repository at <https://github.com/derecho-project/derecho-unified/>. The README hosted at that repository provides installation and usage instructions.

## Documentation

The GitHub README at the derecho-unified repository contains a brief guide to setting up and running a distributed service using Derecho. You can also [read it here](userguide.md). In addition, most of the developer-facing code in Derecho is documented with Doxygen comments, and the generated Doxygen HTML is [hosted at this website](docs/index.html) for your convenience. We hope to publish a more detailed user guide on this website soon.
